                <br>Because I am from East and West <br>
                a mother with two alphabets
                and I must not love one
                more than the other
                if they are to grow up
                and love each other,
                when I speak English
                I make a seat in my voice
                for Arabic.<br>

                <br>Like children these two languages
                love to sit in my lap
                at the same time
                and paw at me for attention . . .<br>

                <br> On the line, Arabic moves
                from right to left
                and English moves
                from left to right . . .<br>

                <br>On the line, at times,
                outside in the world
                it is a line of fire . . .
                But in my heart, all of the time,
                it is a line where the two languages
                walk forth toward each other â€“
                a bride and her beloved . . .<br>

                <br>a family of twenty-nine letters on one side,
                and a family of twenty-six on the other . . .
                They move with a quickening in their hearts . . .<br>

                <br>West tells the East;
                East tells the West;
                I have missed you.
                Come sit by me.
                I do. I do. I do.
                Teach me more about yourself.<br>

                <br>And when death comes
                it does not part us
                for the alphabets live. . .
                for in your beginning
                there was the word
                and in my beginning,
                the angel instructed:
                Iqra'; Iqra'; Iqra'
                Read. Read. Read
                were the first words.<br>

                <br>The zero of the Arabic numerals
                is the ring
                of eternity . . .<br>
