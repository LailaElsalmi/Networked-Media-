## Process:

Document your process here. This can be done via markdown in this file or a link to a Google Doc / Notion / shareable service.
Be sure to include what you were successful with, what did not work for you, and any links you referenced for help (this includes but is not limited to: stackoverflow, MDN documentation, places you pulled art etc)
If you used AI, be sure to cite it correctly via the [Harvard AI Citation Guide](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=1330621&p=10046069)
